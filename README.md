# Hand-gesture-control-presentation

My project aim is to manage computer, laptops and other devices with hand gestures only rather than pointing, clicking the mouse or touching the display directly. The system has some functionalities using finger gestures like to scroll up rising  index finger, to scroll down using thumb finger, Zoom out, Zoom in, Cursor control and Clicking. The Key Features are cost effective, user-friendly and interactive hands-free solution.
